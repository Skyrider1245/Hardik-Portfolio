                <h2>Hi, I'm Hardik Sharma</h2>
                <p>I'm a passionate web developer with a focus on creating seamless user experiences and functional websites. I specialize in front-end technologies, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I love learning new tools and technologies to enhance my skills and make my projects better.</p>
                <p>When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring the outdoors, reading tech blogs, or playing video games. My mission is to build not just websites, but also a better web for everyone.<br> I'm a passionate Information Technology student with a strong drive to innovate and create. From a young age, I’ve been fascinated by the way technology shapes the world around us, and that curiosity has fueled my journey into the IT field.

                    Currently, I’m deepening my knowledge in areas like web development, programming languages, and software engineering. Whether it's crafting intuitive websites with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, or diving into the world of back-end development with Node.js and Express, I love building solutions that not only work but add value to the user.
                    
                    Along with my interest in coding, I’m always keen to explore new technologies. Lately, I've been diving into the realm of cloud computing and artificial intelligence—fields that are transforming the way we live and work. I enjoy taking on real-world challenges and learning through hands-on projects that allow me to grow and apply my skills in meaningful ways.
                    
                    What excites me most is how technology has the power to solve complex problems, and I aspire to contribute to that by working on innovative projects in the future. My journey is not just about learning how things work, but about experimenting, failing, and improving as I go.
                    
                    Outside of academics, I love participating in coding competitions and hackathons, where I can test my skills against other talented developers and learn new tricks. I also enjoy collaborating on open-source projects, as I believe in the power of community and the importance of giving back to the tech ecosystem.
                    
                    I’m always excited to connect with fellow tech enthusiasts, share ideas, and collaborate on projects. If you’re working on something interesting or just want to talk tech, feel free to reach out!</p>
